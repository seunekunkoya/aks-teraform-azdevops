Folder's golden rule
------------
-	Store secrets
-	File containing password are ignored by any git push


Secret files
------------
-	backend-jdld.json : stores the credential to write Terraform backend files
    - Content sample ==>
    ```json
        {
            "tenant_id": "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "subscription_id": "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "client_id": "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "client_secret": "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
        }
    ```
-	main-jdld.tfvars : stores the credential to write in Infra and Apps Resource groups and store the VM credentials
    - Content sample ==>
    ```hcl
    subscription_id = "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
    service_principals = [
    {
        Application_Name   = "sp_infra" #Subscription Owner & Read directory data on Windows Azure Active Directory
        Application_Id     = "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
        Application_Secret = "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx"
        Application_object_id = "xxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx" #To get this param : $(Get-AzureRmADServicePrincipal -DisplayName $Application_Name).Id
    },
